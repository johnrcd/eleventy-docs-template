# eleventy_docs_template

This repository is a template for building websites for documentation. It uses [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) as a static site generator.

Note that this template was designed around my own use cases, and may be more opinionated than it should be. For a more generic Eleventy project template, you may want to consider my [Eleventy PagesCMS project](https://github.com/johnrcd/eleventy_pagescms_base), which is a more general-purpose repository that has support for PagesCMS as it's content management system by default.

## Features

- All documentation-related pages stored in `/content/docs/`
- Majority of links
