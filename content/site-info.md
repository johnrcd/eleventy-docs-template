# Site Information

This site was created with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a static site generator, using the [eleventy-docs-template](https://github.com/johnrcd/eleventy_docs_template). If you're interested in creating a website for documenting something (and you're comfortable with programming), feel free to check it out!

Assuming nothing has changed from the template...

- YAML is used as the data file type.
- Nunjucks is used as the (predominant) template file type.
- Pages are written in Markdown.
	- If you don't know what Markdown up, it's a marginal step up from raw text, with small additions like **bold** and *italics* and lists. It's much easier to write than HTML.
	- If the word *italics* doesn't look italic but the word *bold* does, it's because the font the website is currently using doesn't have italics support.
	- If you're wondering why I brought that up, it's because (at the time of writing) the font I chose doesn't support italics.
- The logo was created in Paint MS.

## about the creator

As the default text within this project template, I can't give you any information about the person using it... because I don't know who they are! I suppose you could ask yourself.

(And maybe, ask them why they haven't updated the site info page!)
